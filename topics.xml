but we don't April fool ourse'ves, be
cause that would be rather cruel.
I have outgrown the frolicsomenes
of April 1, of course; still I always look
carefully after my coat tails on that
day. And I greatly enjoy the motley
of those who are careless about their
parraental caudals during the Feast of
All Fools. The sight makes me feel
quite a boy again, for we youngsters
used to do that sort of thing in Phila
delphia thirty years ago. 0 yes, I did
It, too. I believe that some of the live
lier children of Philadelphia do it yet,
and have vitality and energy enough
left to laugh at the result, as a comio
paragrapher would say.
The most foolhardy of all the tricks
which I can recall in connection with
this carnival of jeering and nonsense
Is one that I have never seen played
Eince I was old enough to require two
digits to express my age. A bag and
two boys were the ingredients of the
trick, and it never failed to 6core a
great success on a quiet side street.
One boy got into the bag and the other
Stood by it waiting for the victim. The
rest of the boys who were "in on the
ground floor" were hiding in hallways
and doors and behind trucks across
the street. An innocent citizen came
W sauntering along. The boy who had
hold of the neck of the bag stopped
him with a "Say, mister, please give
toe a lift, will yer?" The innocent cit
izen usually acquiesced and took hold
of the bag to land it on the youngster's
shoulder. Just as he got it fairly in
his hands the boy in the bag suddenly
kicked and screamed. Innocent vic
tim, thinking it a bagful of wildcats
or hypnas. let go quickly and ran off
with palpitating heart and hair on end.
while all the boys across the street
pursued him with a villainous chorus
of "April fool 1 April fool! Wash
.your face and go to sclioU" or
something to the same effect. It
Talways seemed to me that the joke
was really on the boy in the bag;
he was sometimes dropped hastily
and heavily and was hurtand occa
sionally the April-fooled citizen gave
him a thrashing besides for being too
funny. But it was an effective trick.

TO LESSEN THE DEVTL'S FOOLS.
I am abked for a sentiment concern
ing April Fool's day and pause in the
whirl and rush of a righteous warfare
to say that in my opinion time is far
too valuable and important a factor
for a moment to be lost in foolish jest
ing or senseless joking. The world,
especially in these days, is in far too
critical and dangerous a position, so
cially and religiously, to allow of a
man with average sense to saj' noth
ing of those who have consecrated
brains to indulge in any other than
profitable and upright intercourse.
It is a personal relief to me to feel
that in our ranks seventeen hundred
officers and sixteen thousand unpaid
local workers will be pushing with
might and main of soul an enterprise
which upholds sincerity and the ne
cessity of lessening the devil's fools.

A CHA3IPI0X FOR THE DAT.
Before stating what jokes seem to
me timely, and enjc&abJe ior this
S&-
WIPE DE FLOOB WID niil."
April Fool's day, I cannot resist th
temptation to say that I think the
spirit of the holiday itself hat always
been singularly misunderstocd. The
day is really to be deemed a pause in
time's serious flight, when folly could
with propriety travesty wisdom, and
set the world smiling. As it is, the
first of April has come to be deemed a
nuisance, wheu its observance is not
don away with entirely. April Fool's
day is sadly in need of soue one to
champion it and xestoi e it to its right
ful place in the calendar. It is not
simply the day on which the boys and
girls may make fools of their elders
with impunity. I suspect that there
was a time when it was regarded
rightly, far away as that time seems
to us now. Then the old people put
aside their serious looks and grew
younger instead of older.
If it takes a wise man to be a fool,
surely April first is the feast day
of the saircs. when thev can act on
Shakcspsare's admonition: "Mingle a
little folly with your wisdom."
As for those jokes which seem to mi
good and appropriate to the dav it
should always be understood that the
element of surprise is the essential
thing. Novelty is wit. Jokes must not
bo cruel pranks, otherwise the day
would ba given up to a general hazing
of everybody. The most successful of
April Fool jokes would be to surprise
one's friends by a change of character.
What a rare joke it would be for the
confirmed miser to bestow a dowry
upon that niece of his who needs only
a little money to marry the lad of her
choice. If all the cranks would put
rside their hobbies for a day, what fun
it would be for the rest of us.
This kind of joke can be carried out
ad finitum and would never fail to bo
successful. Let the tippler remain
sober to-day just as a joke. The skin
flint employer can have a lark with
his clerk by granting that increase of
salary that has been talked about so
long. Let the clergyman I say it
reverently preach a sermon only an
hour long to-day instead of one of
four hours' duration. I am convinced
that the idea would meet with success.
People too old for jokes on April
Fool's day? Xouscnc. Even the gray
heads can have their joke. The repro
bate roue can go to church this morn
ing and explain that it is all a joke on
his part. Many a man is ashamed to do
a good thing because it is so unusual
with him that it would give him un
pleasant prominence. But he can do
it to-day and escape with the admis
sion that it is his April fool joke. I
am glad the day comes on Sunday this
year.</text>

April dawned bright and beaming and
kept merry throughout its. first day
blithely warbling between laughs, "Al!
fools look alike to me."
In spite of the fin de siecle pessimist
and his prophecy that All Fool's day was
a landmark of the past, the jester was
out In splendid form and landed gudgeons
galore.
The fun began early and lasted late.
A very few new jokes were perpetrated
and all the old ones revived, while the
usual good humor of both jester and vic
tim prevailed during the entire day. The
email boy was not so much in evidence
;is in previous years. Thoughts of Easter
eggs on the morrow, coupled with the ar
duous duties of trying on new suits and
boots and hats, drove for once all
thoughts of mischief from the mind of
the budding lords of creation. The offi
cials at the Morgue were the first to fall
victims to the merriment- of the day.
When the day was but a half hour old
—at 12:30 a. m.— a telephone call, pre
sumably coming from the Receiving Hos
pital, summoned a Deputy Coroner to take
charge of a body at the Hobson House.
"Hurry-up wagon" and Deputy went
quickly to the place, only to find that
April had dawned and that some one un
known wa? taking liberties with dignified
city officials.
In fact, the Morgue, or. rather, the
Morgue's telephone, was the greatest fcuf
fen-r during the day. The bell rang un-
-ceasingly from early morning until mid
i night and all sorts of messages were
voiced- over the line. Heartless wretches
also employes this method of fooling un
suspecting friends.

•'Hfllo. No. 1947! Ts this Mr. Wilson?"
"No: this is the Morgue."
A bang— that's Mary's telephone— a

While people were having fun at the

Its own pet little April fool joke—repeat
ing the prank over and over a^aln and
hailing each new victim with shouts of
applause and the shrill tooting of horny.
At the junction of Market. Kearny. and
Third streets at regular intervals a box,
neatly packed and stamped, as though
rc-ady for mailing, would glare the guile

a man, woman and child, representing all
sorts and conditions of society, stooped
to pick up the innocent-appearing box.
None got any farther than the attempt.
The shouts of the crowd, many of them
previous victims, scared the parcel-picker
off, and he hastily lost himself in the
throng and waited in his turn for some
one to laugh at.
It was both a costly and hair-raising
April fool experience that Walter Mosier
had. Mosier. a young man possessed with
an ambition to learn dentistry, is em
ployed by Dr. Perkins, a Sixth-street den
tist. Walter's bogs occasionally allows
him to putter around the molars of his
customers who are out of funds.
One of thes? occasions arose Friday and
Mosier was delegated to perform the
charity service. The, victim was a boy
about 12 years of age. He was suffering
from an ulcerated tooth, and Mosier de
cided that the nerve must be killed, so
forthwith he filled the cavity in the
troublesome tooth with enough arsenic
to kill a horse and sent the unfortunate
youth home happy.
When Dr. Perkins came in Mosier, with
the dignity of a full-fledged dentist, told
his employer of his charity work. Then
Dr. Perkins thought of April fool.</text>

The continuance of customs— especially

In England, from earliest times, th»

called "sleeveless errands." but the origin
and true significance of this term ar»
completely buried in oblivion and no an

period of eight days. April 1 Is the
octave of March 25, and the last day
of a festival octavo was always marked
by the greatest abandon and festivity.
At the New Year season especially all
sorts of wild, mirthful pranks were In
dulged In, and of these It is believed that
our April fool usages were a part.
Origins of a religious nature have been
boldly claimed for April Fools' day by
many writers. An old English antiquary,
writing In 1753. states that the custom of
imposing upon and ridiculing people on
the Ist of April may have an allusion to
the mockery of the Savior of the world
by the Jews. Something like that which
we call making April fools Is practiced
also abroad in Catholic countries on In
nocents' day, on which occasion people
run through all the rooms, making a pre
tended search in and under the beds. In
memory, I believe, of the search made by
Herod for the discovery and the destruc
tion of the child Jesus and of his having
been imposed upon and deceived by the
wise men, who, contrary to his orders
and expectation, "returned to their own
country another way."
When the early Britons were Induced to
forsake' their Druidical priests and Idols
and to embrace Christianity, It was their
custom" for many years after to annually
hold in their churches at the commence
ment of April a great festival, resem
bling the Roman Saturnalia, at which
they indulged in a thousand ridiculous
and indecent ceremonies, gambols and
dancing grotesquely to ludicrous anthems.
These singular observances referred to the
exploded pretensions of the Druids, whom
this festival was designed to hold up to
scorn and derision. That there Is no more
effective weapon than ridicule was again
proved In this case, for this feast of fools
""Whence proceeds the custom of making
April fools? Answer: From a memorable
transaction happening between the
Romans and the Sabine.3, mentioned by
Dionysius. Which was thus: The Romans,
about the Infancy of their city, wanting
wives, and finding they could not obtain
the neighboring women by their peaceable
addresses, resolved to make use of strata
gem, and accordingly Romulus instituted
certain games to be performed in the be
ginning of April (according to the Roman
calendar) in honor of Neptune. Upon no
tice thereof the bordqring Inhabitants,
with their whole families, flocked to Rome
to see this mighty celebration, whereupon
the Romans seized a number of the Sablna
virgins and ravished them, which imposi
tion, we suppose, may be the foundation
of this foolish custom." This most absurd
and wholly unjustifiable account of the
origin of making April fools is thus ridi
culed by a poet of the time:
Ye witty tiparks who makes pretense
To answer questions with good sense.
How cornea.it that your monthly Phoebus
Is made a fool by Dionysius?
For had the Sablnen, as they -came,
D-partpd with their, vlrirln fame.
The Romans had been Jtyled dull tools,
"And they, poor Rlrls. been April Fools.
Therefore. If this be" n't out of season,
Pray, think and give a better reason.
Some old folk-writers claim that our
April Fool customs are attributable to the
fact that the year formerly began, as to
come purposes and in some respects, on
the 25th of March, which was supposed
?o be the day of Our Lord's incarnation.
At that time' it was customary for all
festivals to continue for an octave, or
(Copyright and nil rights reserved.)
"The first of April lome do say.
TVoa «et apart for All Fools' Day;
But why the people call It «o.
Nor I nor they therr.reUes do know."
Thus an old English poet sings truly,
for It would be a hard matter to find any
one who can give an accurate and correct
account of how the Ist of April came to
be known as All Fools' day and of the ori
gin of the custom pertaining to It of then

Last Month Third Coldest ia Tweaty
SIx Years.
The month just passed was the
third coldest March in the last twenty
six years, according to the local
Weather Bureau. In 1906 and 1912
the average temperature was slight
ly lower than for last month. The
emperature was 6 degrees below the
March normal.
There were no extremely cold days
In March, 1915, however. The low
average was due to the fact that there
were no warm days, as is usually the
case. Several times before the tem
perature on a day in March has been
below zero, while the lowest last
month was 22. Never before, however,
has the maximum temperature for any
March day been as low as it was this
month, 63 degrees.
About a third of the usual precipita
tion fell last month. The heavy snow
on March 4 was responsible for most
of the precipitation. Nevertheless,
there were only two clear days in the
entire month.

and Teddy Blake and I don't think it's fair.
His folks are real poor, and his mother's sick
almost all the time. They make fun of his
boots, you knotf and they are dreadful things,
really and so they're going to hang one of the
boxes that new shoes come in on the door, with
a bundle of papers in it, and 'April-Fool'
printed on the inside piece. And they're going
to look in the window and see Micky when he
gets it. Fred's fooled me lots of times to-day,
but I don't caro for that. I don't think it's
much fun, though, and it's mean to fool that
little Micky Lanahan. So
Flo's cheeks gloAved cherry red, and sho
talked rapidly. Flora listened with kindling
eyes.
"Flo," she cried, "I'll tell you what to do.
All the time my ankle's been sprained, you
know, I haA'en't spent my pocket money. I've
got tAvo dollars noA, and I was going to buy
you a birthday present; but I'll spend it for a
pair of shoes for Micky instead, if you're will
ing." Was Flo willing She almost screamed with
delight.
Oh, yon dear Flora sho cried. And I'll
change the boxes Oh, Flora Millings, what
fun! Such a joke on Fred and Teddy! And
Fred said ho wouldn't bo fooled once this April.
Oh, oh!"
Flo could not wait. Sho put on her hat and
almost flew down to tho shoo store and home
again. Fred's box neatly tied up Avas on tho
table hall waiting for night, and. it was only
tho work of a moment to replace tho little
bundle of papers with a pair of stout shoes.
"Such fun said Flo to herself, and she al
most burst out laughing when, after tea, Fred
took the box from the hall table and Avent off
Avith Teddy Blake.
"After ail, I don't half like this," he said to
Teddy. "If it was any other fellow I wouldn't
caro a snap. But of course it's only in fun. I
told him Ave'd introduce him."
"Of course," laughed Teddy; and so they
made their way down a cross street and
through an alley to the little tumble-down
houso Micky Lanahan called home.
Fred put tho box doAvn quietly at tho door
and rapped. They had plenty of timo to dodgo
around tho corner of tho houso to a Avindow;
and they Avero looking in even before Micky
had His hand on tho hitch.
It Avas such a poor littlo room, bare-walled,
bare-floored, and scantily furnished! A thin
faced Avonian sat bolstered up in tho only rocking-chair
it contained, and. a lamp burned
dimly on tho rickety table. Tho big boots stood
in a corner, and Avhen Fred's gazo fell upon
thein ho suddenly turned it tho other way.
VTed," ho AA'hispered, "I AVish ayo hadn't. I
do wish avo hadn't, Ted."
Thero Avas a shrill cry of joy from Micky
then. He had opened tho door and discovered
the box, and hbj freckled face was beaming
Avith delighted surpriso Avhen he came back:
into the room.
Och, mother, it do bo shoes ho cried.
Tho thin AA'hito face in tho rocking-chair was
turned eagerly toAvard tho boy.
Sure it can't be tho truth, Micky."
Deed it is mother!" cried Micky, tugging
at tho string. What elso should it bo now 'f
Fred at tho Avindow groaned inwardly.
Add to SSy&ivo a dollar to bo out of it, Ted. I don't
SCO
"Youdidityoursolf," said Teddy, not very
good-naturedly. You thought of it, and all,
but I'd givo another dollar it wo hadn't, and
that's a fact. Let's go."
Wait," said Fred. Wo'll make this up
Hullo! Why, Ted Ted Blako I"
For Micky had got the troublesome twine
unknotted at last, and had pulled from the box
thoso stout thick shoes. AudhoAvas caticring
about the room Aild Avith with joy.
"Beaut they illegant, mother? Oh, mother,

on tho paper! Sure it's a foino ould gintlcman

"Then April-Fool never did a bettor piooo of
work," said Teddy, fooling not a bit ashamed
of tho tears that filled his own eyes almost to
overflowing. "But I say, old fellow" and ho
began to laugh.
I think you cannot imagine two more as
tonished boys than those Avho slid softly nAvay
from Mrs. Laualian's window and hastened off
home in tho darkness.
"Such a good joke!" laughed Fred." "Inover
Avas so glad of anything in my life."
We'll pay for thoso shoes, anyhow," said
Teddy. "Can't you gucs3Avho did it, Fred?"
"I think 'twas Flo and Flora," Fred answered.
"Anyway, I'm almost suro Flo had a finger in

Professor Soley's opening chapters deal with the gen
eral conditionof the Navy at theontbreak of the war,
the peculiar difficulties before it, and ihe way In which
the difficulties were met. This part of the book covers
nearly all the earliest operations, including passages
like the fight between the Monitor and Merrixnac, the
exploit of Cu3hing at Wilmington, and his far more fa
mous destruction of the Albemarle, anil some of the
finest acts of individual heroism in the history of tho
War. The exciting episodes of hlockade-rncnbjg. and
the sea-fights like that between the Kearsirgc and Ala
bamawhich enter into the main and later portions of
the book, unite to make for the first time a worthy and
authentic account of this aide of our naval history.

        <text>MANY ARE FOOLED1
Victims of April 1 Jokers
Numerous Today.
NEW AND ANCIENT PRANKS
Purse and Hidden Brick Tricks.
"Mr. Lyon" and "Mr. Fish*'
Much Sought After.
A ro!o~e<1 man laboriously pushed a
wheelb*rrow up Capitol Hill today, and
an be pushed he puffed and panted. On
the ba r?iw v>bj> a bin box. R11(l current
report l;a? !t that the b'.x was filled with
brtvkUsi" iuvI wet Baud. The heceptaele
Tnuil ha?e weighed close to half a. ton.
I'ndtn* tha crown of the man's hat was
a communtrtlton to a young business
man In Southeast Washington. The cum
miiiilcatlon read:
"Hand the da.'iged fool further."
The colored man must have overlooked
the fart that today Is April 1. commonly
known cs "All .Foola' day," and that he
was the victim of a practical joke that
has been practiced on the. unsuspecting
for years. At last accounts the man
with the wheelbarrow was headed for a
grocery store in West Washington and
was still pushing the load of worthies?
brickbats and sand.
Something on His Collar.
"Hold on there, mister, there's some
thing or. yer collar."' a street urchin
yelled at a dignified old gentleman on the
avenue today.
The venerable citizen halted and, brush
ing at his collar, demanded:
"What is on my collar, boy?"
"Your necktie," shouted the youngster, I
as he darted away, while the pedestrians
laughed at the April fool jok".
The anci? nt and whi'e-whiskered pock
et book joke was practiced at many places
today. Pedestrians chased elusive purses
with strings tied to them, to the amuse
ment of passersby and the hoys in hiding.
Men or women who tried to kick paste
board boxes, old hats or bundles from
the sidewalk limped painfully away after
hitting the hidden brick, conversing with
themselves in language that would not be
tolerated in polite society.
Many Disappointed Girls.
The fair sex received many jolts from
mischievous young America today. They
were informed in almost tragic tones that
a big spider was climbing up their backs,
or else warned to "look out for that
mouse."
A late twentieth century April fool fad
was practiced today by some of the
practical j?>kers. l,arge boxes handsome- j
ly arranged were sent to the homes of I
young women. When opened the recipi-i
ents, who expected to find a spring hat j
or some other useful article, were con-1
fronted by a printed Billikin man and j
the words. "April fool for you," or by
a paper doll and the inscription. "I love
my gal, but oh, you April fool paper
kirido."
The shibboleth of today is "April
f-o-o-1," yellwi lustily by small bovs or
eirls at luckless victims of their pranks.
Even staid and solemn senators and rep
resentatives were caught in the foolerv
net.
The officials of the Zoo received manv
fool calls today. Business men found on
their.desks slips of paner requesting them
to all Columbia 38K! and ask for "Mr.
I.?yon. When try officers of the Zoo
responded they would say:
"Col." Elephant or '"Judge" Fox.
Mr. I .ion cannot he gotten just now.
but if you will wait a moment Col. Kle
phant or Judge Fox will talk to you."
Then it was that the joke o{ the matter
suddenly dawned upon the business man
and he dropped the phone receiver in
disgust.
The officers of the T'nited States fish
commission also were bothered today by
victims of All Fools' day calling for "Mr. I
Fish."
One man was induced to call up Fort
Myer and ask for "Mr. Cannon." He was
Informed that.Speaker Cannon was at the
fort wat hing a drill and desired to com
municate with the victim of the April
fool joke.
Ancient history relates that April l has
been recognized for many centuries as a
lay for practical jokes and an occasion I
for sending persons on "fools' errands</text>

        <text>THE BOSTON SUBWAY
SATISFACTORY SOLUTION OF THE
STREET CAR PROBLEM.
Contention of Trafllc In tli? Iluny Streets
of the Uub Relieved by Underground
Trolley Lines?Tunnels Tlmt Am Light,
Clean uud Attractive.
It is now possible to cross Tromont
street, Boston, at any point opposite tho
Common and at any time of day without
loss of life or limb. Tho new subway has
brought about tho change.
It 1 s an old tradition that tho fathers of
Boston, when thoy laid out tho city, let
the. streets follow the winding cow paths.
At any rate, the streets ius thoy exist today
urc very crooked and must of them aro
very narrow. This was all right in Revo?
lutionary times, but when the city grow
miles beyond tho Common und spread it?
self out to tho south and west; when busi?
ness centered itself along tbu lower ends
of Washington and Trentont streets, and
when dozens of street car tracks usurped
tho narrow roadways, then the Bostonlans
wished their ancestors bud not stuck so
closely to the cow paths.
Probably no other city on the continent,
was ever so badly allllctcd with a conges?
tion of trnllic as tho Hub haslieon for
many yea: Some of tho most important
street ear linen skirt tho south and east,
cornets ol the Common on Boylston mid
Tremont streets. When I he chango was
made hum hoc. epov.vr to trolley, matters
grew worse. Then tho poles and the tan?
gle of overhead wires made that historic.
breathing spot look liko a pieco of dingy,
green billiard cloth which had become fray?
ed and tuttered around the edges. So after
much wrangling in tho legislature and
courts it w;ls decided tu build the subway
and put the trolley cars underground.
A large portion of the work bus already
lieen accomplished and Boston is delight?
ed with the result. The first thing a Hus?
ton man asks a visitor from Now York,
Chicago or elsewhere is:
"Been through tho subway yet'/ Let's
see?you huven't one in your place, have
you?"
It is, in fact, a triumph of engineering
anil well worth a visit. Then! arc throe
open cut.s where tho trolley curs enter the
subway. One Is out on Tremont street
whore Shawmut avenue comes in. Hero
the tracks from each of those jmorough
fares dive into the tunnel. Another is In
the Public gardens, where the cars com?
ing down Boylston street take tho under?
ground tlip. The third is at tho northerly
end of the subway, just beyond-Hay mar?
ket square and in front of the new Union
terminal railroad station into which the
Fitchburg, Hoston und Maine, Eastern
und other roads run. Theru is u. loop hern
DOSTON'S NEW SUBWAY INCLINE IN THE Plin
LIC ns most of the t rolley lines inako it their
terminus, and, the subway being four
tracked, they disgorge their passengers
and take the back track up town.
Including the inclines or open onto, tho
subway has a total length of 1 miles and
will contain about live miles of track. At
present the branch down Boylston street
along the Common side and the main line
down Tremont to Park street are in oper?
ation. The Shawmut avenue branch and
tho northerly end of the main lino will be
finished within the next eight months.
Ground was broken for the subway in
April, 18115. The sum appropriated was
$7,ii(?0,000 and, wonderful to relate, tho
transit commissioners say that it is proba?
ble the cost will bo about $1,000,000 less
than that sum.
No groat difficulties have been encoun?
tered thus far in digging this big liplo In
the ground. Of course there were count?
less sewers, water pipes, gas pipes, electric
wire conduits and the like und some -III
inch water mains at an inconvenient level
proved rather hnrxl to handle, but n? un?
expected conditions arose to delay tho
work. The main trunk of the subway
runs under the wide walk or mall on tho
east side of the Common, anil when the
excavations were being made the bones of
hundreds of old Puritans were disturbed.
This raised a bowl of righteous Indigna?
tion,and the sncredness of the long forgot
burying ground was harped upon for
weeks. Hut the commissioners quieted
the reverent patriots by collecting nil tho
bones and roiuterrlng them in the holy
ground of the Common, with a nice monu?
ment to mark the spot.
The tleepest jioint of tho subway is on
Boylston street, where the south bound
t racks are laid lit) feet lielow the surface,
but the average depth is 14 feet. The tun?
nel itself is a giant bore with ribs of steel
mid casings! of cement, asphalt, concrete

I that a road might have If It ran through Broad-

j ef all these advantages, three months' experi

lv a failure, save so far as It was a necosslty to re-
i'i Have the congestion of traffic on the street.
V XEED OF TUB BUDWAT.
A Bostonlans are proud of the subway. They
ri take strangers to see It, just as they take them
h to see Bunker IIIll Monument; make them ride
vM the length of It back and forth, and call alien
s' I tlon to all its fine foatures and then they keep

building of tbo subway growoutof a publloneed
Tfhloh was as absolute and pressing as the need
v ef this city for some addition to Its trafllo
in. facilities.
Hien, about ten years ago. the West End

horso car lines of Boston Into electric trot
lines the narrow streets In tho heart of
iton were already choked with tho dally rush
vehicles. Boston has to-day tho most ex

red for tho now service fairly filled

ere they were all concentrated. These
lines eorvo a suburban population of
trly a million persons, and it is possible to

BOSTON IMPROVEMENTS.
Historic Landmarks and Crooked
Streets Disappearing.
Boston, June 20.— Within three years the
crooks and turnings and devious wanderings of
Boston's most honored highways and byways
will be nothing more than a memory of the past,
and many of her ancient landmarks will be
wiped out or so altered as to be unrecognizable
to the oldest inhabitant. Slowly and surely the
ancient thoroughfares are being widened,
straightened and bent into the rulerlike lines oC
i rosscut New- York. Philadelphia and Chicago.
Boston is undergoing a transformation below
arid aloft that would cause Benjamin Franklin.
John Hancock, "Warren and Paul Revere *.o rub
their eyes and stare in amazement. Million dol
lar buildings by the dozen, elevated roads, tun
nels and streetcar lines beneath the streets and
under the harbor, swamps and mud Hats filled
for piers and excavated for docks that ac
':;iinodate giant steamers these are the things
they would see.
Along State-st., beneath the spot where the
Boston Massacre occurred, and beneath the his
toric old State House, a tunnel is eating its way
from under the harbor to Scollay Square to con
nect with the present subway by means of
(lights of stairs and elevators, and thence out
side to the busy world. The old Slat- House
itself is to be transformed into a tunnel station
connecting with a subway line also. The re
modelled building will soon be crowded with
people hurrying back and forth, intent on busi
ness, with never a thought of its old associa
tions. Little do they think, as they hurry past
where tunnel workmen are digsing seventy feet
beneath, of what has happened In that quaint
old edifice. On this site the first State House
was built in 1G57. Destroyed by fire in 1711. it
was rebuilt In 1712, and rebuilt again in 1747,
when destroyed a second time. The building
has been in turn Town House, Courthouse. Prov
ince House, State House and City Hall. <>n the

first floor in the early days was the merchants*
walk, or exchange.
During the Stamp Act excitement the stamped
clearances were burned in front of its doors.
The British troops were quartered within the
building in 17'J.S, and the Boston Massacre oc
curred about fifty feet away on March 1770.
The next day Samuel Adams stood in the coun
cil chamber and made his successful demand
upon the royal representatives fur the immedi
ate removal of the British troops from Boston.
In this same room Generals Clinton, Howe and
Gage held a council of war just before the bat
tle of Bunker Hill. In 17N'J, at the western end
of the State House, Washington reviewed the
great procession in his honor on the occasion of
his last visit to Boston. Here, also, in lSi>s,
William Lloyd Garrison found refuge from a
mob which had broken up an anti-slavery meet
ing, and threatened his life.
The Park-st. station of the present subway
handles I!7,course of its trolley traffic, but the number of
passengers who will pass through the old State
House station will far exceed this number.
The march "f progress does not stop here,
however. Down Washington-st., to connect with
the tunnel and present subway, will be another
subway, this a double one for elevated trains
after they leave tli" surface at the Broadway
extension. It will pass beneath the Old South
Church, the Old Corner Bookstore and other well
known landmarks. Through the tower of the
»lil South Church, which juts out into Washing

Transit railroad, the subway, as It
Is popularly known, nnd the most
colossal undertaking of its kind in
the worlds history, whs formally
opened today with imposing cere
saonies. The exercises took place
under the joint auspices of the Inter
borough company and the board of
aldermen. In City Hull park, where
the great downtown terminal is lo
cated and where the first spadeful
of earth was turned, the principal
ceremonies of the day took place
shortly before noon. The park and
citl hall were lavishly decorated.
Bishop Pottter opened the cere
monies with prayer and was followed
by an address by Alexander E. Orr,
president of the rapid transit com
mission, who turned the subway over
to the city. Mayor McClellan accept
ed the tiust, and then turned the road
over to August Belmont, president of
the Interborough company, who also
made a brief address. Archbishop
Farley closed the ceremonies.
At 1 o'clock the first train was
started over the road, operated by
Mayor McClellan in person. Hands
of music were stationed at all the
principal stops along the route. In
cluded among the passengers on the
first train were the city officials, of
ficials of the Interborough company,
a large party of distinguished engi

Promptly at midnight tonight the
road will be opened to the general

dudes the whole of the main line
from City Hall park to the Harlem
river on the upper west side. It is
expected to have the entire west side
line opened to- traffic within a month
or so nnd also the east side branch
to the Bronx.
The great subway opened today
consists of It miles of railroad under
the city's teeming streets. The actual
work of construction has taken Just
four years and the cost has exceeded
150.000,000. When the entire system
is completed it will enable one to
travel from the limits of Brooklyn
to the northernmost end of Manhat
tan entirely underground.
A dazzling array of facts and fig
ures tell the story of the building
of the mammoth underground road.
For instance, more than 8,000,000
cubic yards of dirt and rock were
blasted Hnd dug from the streets of
the crowded city. To tear away the
rock voo.ooo pounds of dynamite were
used. Eleven thousand men were em
ployed In the work and of this num
ber several hundred lost their lives
through accidents, premature ex
plosions, cave-Ins und falling rock.
It Is estimated that the road will
carry 115,000,000 passengers a year.
The fare Is 5 cents. When the ex
tension to Brooklyn, under the East
river, has been completed It is esti
mated that the road will carry 200,-
UOO.OOO passt-nxers year.
Express trains will run through
the subway at the rate of a mile a

representatives of the Manufacturers
Association and the Textile Council
the mill owners committee refused to
entertain a request for it restoration of
the reduction made in 1904. on the
ground that the manufacturers under
stood that an agreement which was
made with operatives last year provid
ed that the present wage dividend ar
rangeatent should he in force one year.
The Textile Council had no authority
to pass upon these points and referred
the matter to the various unions.
For two months or more the margin
has been so small that no dividend has
been deflated and the cut of 1904 has
therefore prevailed.
Just about this tinn* another explo
sion i courted in a. manhole near the
corner ot Tremont and Flint streets.
Chief Mullen led a party of firemen to
the spot where the burning cables itad
set lire to a pile of newspapers that
had been thrown through a grating
from the street above. Near this spot
is a htrgi steel ventilating fan, and in
leaning against the fan Chief .Mullen
was knocked down by tut electric
shock. He was not seriously injured.
Three manholes at the Pleasant street
entrance to the subway were the next
to be infected, explosions occurring in
all of them.
When three manholes blew out three
persons were slightly injured. Max
Troutman, a 10-year-old newsboy, was
burned about the head; Andrew Heed
of Appleton street was knoeked down
and severely bruised, and .Miss Anna
O. Donnell was knocked down and hurt
by an iron gate of a store which was
blown off its hinges by the force of the
explosion. Several windows in the
neighboi hood were shattered and a de
livery wagon \\;ts wrecked.
At 7.10 P. M.. ;t little less titan two

claimed Brown had entered Ills house
and assaulted him. London ordered,
Brown to leave the room and when1

then reported to Guion. Brown was
at once arrested and taken to the
county jail. At to o’clock Saturday
morning Brown was suddenly taken
ill am! complained of a pain in thn
stomach, where lie said London laid
kicked him. He was at once taken to ills
room at the Riverside house, where lie
died at V o’clock Saturday evening.
London was at once arrested and taken
to tile lockup. At 9.,'rt o'clock Monday
morning the coroner's Inquest was held
and as the result of the autopsy a ver
dict of death as the result of drinking
Jamaica ginger was returned. London
was released from jail soon after the
inquest.
Thomas Capsticks was found on

        <text>CRUSHED TO DEATH
Boston Subway Employe Instantly
Killed, Thursday Evening.
Boston, May 20.—Christopher Miller,
20 years old. unmarried, of 10 Higgins
street, Medford, a signalman employed
by the Boston Elevated Railway, was
killed by a train near the Haymarket
square station of the subway, about
10 o’eloek last night. The train was
just going into the station, north
bound.
Owing to the difficulty of getting at
the body, it being necessary to jack up
the car to do so, a delay of more than
an hour and a half ensued, during
which time no cars ran through the
subway north, and the inconvenience
of the hundreds who wished to reach
the North station between 10 and the
time the last train left the station was
great.
It was Miller's duty each night about
9 o'clock to start at one end of the sub
way and go through inspecting the
block signals. When a train came along
he had to back up against the wall of
the subway as it parsed. He was in
specting the signal that stands within
five feet of the Haymarket square stn
tion when he was killed. The motor
man r,f the train. Samuel B. Francis,
saw Miller at the signal, and noticed
that he ptepared for the coming of the
train and stool close up against the
wall In a niche, and out df harm's way.
Just as the train drew into the sta
tion a cry was heard. A signal to stop
at once was given, and the train was
brought to a standstill. Most of the
train was within the station, and as
soon as the gates of the ears were
opened the passengers flocked out of
the train to see what had happened.
The road employes jumped from the
end of the station and found the
crushed body of Miller under the rear
trucks of the smoking car.
It was impossible to remove the body
without jacking up the ear. The rear
car was unoccupied and the ethers were
taken ahead a short distance and the
wrecking crew was sent for. When ttiey
arrived jacks were applied to the It was raised far enough to get the body
cmt. it was nearly an hour after the ac
cident happened that the body was taken
from under the car. It was carried to
Briggs' undertaking rooms on Howard
street.
Until a formal statement of the accident
was given out to the press by the. Boston
elevated at 1 o’clock, this morning, t lie
greatest efforts to suppress the facts were
made.
When Briggs' undertaking wagon ap
peared at tlio station the police knew'
then that something serious had occurred
and Patrolman Palmer and others forced
their way into the station and made an
investigation, later notifying Medical Ex
aminer Draper.
The body of Miller was badly mangled.
There was no doubt that death must iiave
been practically instantaneous.
While it is all presumption as to how
the accident really happened, the theory
reached by the police after their investiga
tion was that while Miller was standing
close up to the wall as the train passed,
his footing was none too secure and that
he cither slipped under the train or that
the sta tion drew him down and tinder.
Traffic on the northbound tracks in the
subway was not resumed until 11.30 or
later, and people intending to use trains
going in that direction were put to great
annoyance, for there was practically no
substitute route that they could take.
Those who wisheil to get from the thea
ters to trains in the North station were
the greatest sufferers. They poured into
tlie Boylston street. Park street and Scol
lay square stations and were told to either
walk or go to Washington street and
take surface ears, which are rather scarce
at that time of night. Scores of people
missed their trains; calls were at a pre
mium. and old and young men anil wo
men could be seen running in droves down
Washington and Tremont streets toward
the station.</text>

Wagons May Now Be Run by
Electricity.
Chicago, Aug, 10.— A novelty in the
way of a wagon propelled by electricity
was seen on the streets of Chicago yes
terday. Some time ago President J. B.
McDonald, of the American Battery
company, purchased several patents
from William Morrison, of Dcs Moines.
Among other things was a park wagon
equipped with a small three-horse-power
motor and twenty-four-cell storage bat
tery. Yesterday Mr. McDonald fitted
the wagon with new batteries and gave
it a trial. With five persons in the
wagon it left the barn on Monroe
street and traveled to the company's
office. The run was made in twenty
two minutes, which was considered a
satisfactory, considering that the wagon
was delayed at a bridge and that fre
quent stops were, made on account of
the crowds in the streets down town.
It is calculated that the wagon can
make ten miles an hour easily with the
present motor and can climb any bill in
the city.TWIN CITY JOCKEY CLUB

        <text>The earliest horseless carriage which is
preserved today is one now on exhibition
in Paris at the Conservatoire dcs Artes
et Metiers. This machine was invented
by Cugnot in 1769 and was made to op
erate by steam, the energy of which
was applied through two perpendicular
piston tubes. The principal reason per- j
haps why the French steam automobile
was not brought to a state of compara
tive perfection during the last century
was the beginning of the revolution.
The turbulence which accompanied that
event naturally turned men's minds
from .peaceful and civilizing pursuits to I
thoughts of warfare and the deposing of 1
NUGGETS FROM EVERYWHERE.
Senator Simon of Oregon has been

ing?" some one asked him recently.
"J'.wh'T tl*it or the neighbors are get
ting inure used to it," he replied.

running down his cheeks, said, "D'ye
tliink I could c;et the young beggar

The late Senator Morrill, though he
monarchs. But it was in all likelihood
from the Cugnot steam carriage that i
Stephenson indirectly obtained his idea j
for a locomotive on rails.
j At the Exposition Universelle in Paris
I in 187S a steam automobile was exhibit-
I ed very like that of Cugnot, the only
j difference being that the frame of. the
j more modern vehicle was built after the
J plan of a common road carriage and not
jas a velocipede. This automobile, how- I
ever, was not a very satisfactory ma- j
chine, and it was not until 12 years later
that MM. Serpollet and Archdeacon in- i
vented a steam automobile, with which j
they journeyed from Paris to L.yons in
ten days. In 1894 the automobile first
gave promise of actual adaptability for j
general transportation and traction j
purposes. In that year the editor of the
Petit Journal organized the first auto
mobile race, which was run from Paris j
to Rouen. In this contest the steam
horseless carriage, while proving itself
cumbersome, noisy and uncouth in ap
pearance, showed itself superior to its
electrical and gasoline propelled rivals
of that time. The following year an
other race was run, this time from Paris
to Bordeaux and return, but in this test
it was the electrical carriage that prov
ed itself the superior machine.
Up to this time the construction of
these carriages had been conducted
along the ugly lines of a buggy or four
wheeled cart instead of seeking an in
dividuality for themselves through de
j signs more fitting to their peculiar qual
ities. Today, however, it might be said
that they have evolved an individuality
of their own. Automobile mechanics is
an art the nicety of which is only un
derstood by those who are of the pro
fession.
But one of the great difficulties that
still face the constructors of horseless
carriages is the problem of expense. A
Parisian made automobile victoria, for
instance, costs some $800 and an auto
mobile tricycle $300. The heavier car
riages are proportionately expensive.
This costliness of manufacture, how
ever, is a drawback that time will put
right,- just as has been the case with
the bicycle. But while the initial outlay
for an automobile Is still very large this
is more than compensated for by the in
significant extent of operating expenses,
the fuel for the petroleum propelled ye-
hides costing merely 1% cents per hour.
The development of the automobile as
a thing of beauty will take place only
when its place is assured and its use is
general, when people of means and
fashion will begin to demand certain
characteristics of design and finish to
differentiate their carriages from the
vehicles of the livery and the cab stand.

dies who have their own private auto
mobiles and may be seen any day
speeding noiselessly along the more
fashionable streets of that city. It takes
some skill and experience to operate
one of these powerful horseless car
riages, for, after all, they are mere lo
comotives and not unconnected with
danger in the hands of the inexperi
enced. In Paris the authorities require
each operator of an automobile to pass
a practical examination, after which
he is given a certificate of efficiency.
The local history of Paris, neverthe
less, .for the past two years has been
lively enough with runaways, collisions,
upsets and explosions of a more or less
serious nature. New York has also had
its list of little accidents.
There is one thing that the motor car
riage demands, and that is good roads.
We are already indebted to the bicycle
for an improvement in the condition of
our highways, but when the automobile
comes into general use both the great
unthinking public and governmental
bodies will become impressed with' the
necessity for a better class of roadmak
ing. As things now are, the United
States stands lowest on the list of ad
vanced countries in the matter of good
highways. Another advantage of the
use of the horseless vehicle will be that
our streets will be found more health-
customed to lay their books and pa
pers. "May it please the court," be
gan the diminutive counsel, when the
chief justice broke in, "Mr. Burnett, it
is the custom of lawyers to rise while
addressing this court."
jOn a recently bitterly cold night
Speaker Reed had occasion to ride on a
street car the conductor of which neg
ligently left the door open, to the great
discomfort of the passengers. Mr. Reed
beckoned to the railway official and
when the latter came inside asked,
"Why have you got your collar turned
up, my friend?" "It's mighty cold," re
sponded the conductor, "and I want to
keep warm." "So do the rest of us,"
ful and cleaner than is now possible.
j Stabling will no longer be necessary in
cities, and there will be more room on
j city streets. The wearing noise of traf
fie will be hushed, and pneumatic tires
and silent generators *or storage batter
ies will do away with the roar of wheels
j and the rattle of horses' feet. In our
country, fortunately, there is no legis
lation and no popular prejudice against
I the automobile, as in England, for in
stance, where only a little over a year
i ago prohibitory legislation with regard
to the use of such carriages in London
was repealed. Until this action was
taken it was necessary that all horse
less carriages should be preceded by a
man on foot or on horseback bearing a
I red flag as a warning of the approach
of the terrible engine of destruction.
Animal power has ever been capri
cious and uncertain, while machinery is
j reliable and always sure. An automo
bile does not require continual atten-
tion, as does an animal. While not in
use the automobile entails no operating
expenses, and all that can be charged
to its idleness is the interest on the
original outlay for its purchase. Nor
will it grow old and die, like a horse.
When its day's work is done, it can be
run into a shed and stand there until
once more called upon to do service.
So long as it remaijis one of the deep
rooted characteristics of man, the most
restless of all animals, to be in the
place where he is not he will see to it
that his means of transportation are as
expedient, inexpensive and comfortable
as circumstances will permit. It has
taken him some time to reach the age
of the automobile, but it might be said
that such an age has at last arrived.
The passing of the horse furnishes
food for much profound thought and
reflection. It is a farreaching question, j
affecting almost all kinds and condi
tions of men. What will become of the
smith who hitherto eked out his frugal
existence in the wayside village under
the spreading chestnut tree? What will
become of the hay and feed man who
has so long and so profitably catered to
the inner wants of our old time equine
friend? What will become of the farm
er and his hay crop and his field of
oats? What will become of the costly
livery stable and the harness maker and
the veterinary surgeon?
It is no easy matter to figure out the
Immediate or even the ultimate im
provement in the general condition of
affairs which will result from the adop-
observed the speaker. "Suppose you
shut the door!" It is needless to add
that the passengers were comfortable
during the remainder of the trip.
A characteristic of the late William
Black was his ignorance of his own
books, and it was very difficult to get
him to talk about his novels. It seem
ed that as soon as the proof sheets were
returned to the printers Mr. Black for
got all about his own creations, "in
talking to my husband the other day,"
Mrs. Black once said fto a visitor, "I
suddenly remembered an anecdote in
one of his novels which illustrated what
I was saying. Mr. Black laughed hearti
ly at the story and then turned eagerly

is borne in mind that many disturbing
elements enter into the problem. Al
ready there has been a great falling oft
in the production ef horses and a depre
ciation in the value of horseflesh, which
i has filled the farmer and the horse
breeder with apprehension. But, for
tunately, these questions have the habit
jof settling and adjusting themselves.
j When it is remembered that there are
j now millions of acres of land devoted to
the growing of crops for horse food
alone, which in time may and must be
I devoted to the production of food for
I the human beings who are engaged in
the manufacture of the very machines
that are displacing the horse, the prob
lem is not so intricate and the outlook
is not so dark as it at first seems.
The poor old cab horse has always
had his drawbacks as a working ma
chine, and even with an animal en
dowed with all the noble attributes of
I the horse the question of economics can
not be kept out of the calculation. It
costs at least 60 cents a day to keep the
ordinary steed that travels up and down
a city's streets, and if he chances to be
a cab horse and times are good he will
I travel about 25 miles, on an average, on
that amount of nourishment. But he re
j quires at least eight hours' sleep and
rest, to say nothing of an occasional
day off as a result of colic, which leaves
I him a working capacity of 16 hours.
Most of the time, however, he spends in
j loafing around on street corners and
dreamily digesting his 60 cents' worth
of oats and hay.
It is commonly supposed that all cab
horses live about 100 years, but this is
one of those popular errors which have
no actual foundation in fact. His ten
ure of life averages, appearances to the
contrary, about 15 years, and at 60 cents
a day His feed in that time will amount
to only $3,275, for which, if he has
led an industrious, sober and unpam
pered life, he covers some 109,500 miles.
This newfangled automobile that is
elbowing its four footed rival off the
streets of the city, on the other hand,
will travel the same distance for about
$1,000, expended in fuel or electricity,
and while doing so will never have to
be sent to the blacksmith shop to be
shod, the average cost of repairs being
no more than that for the ordinary car
riage hauled by horses.
A French writer who has made a
study of the horseless carriage a spe
cialty has been figuring out its ultimata
to me, 'But where did you hear so good
a story?' My husband wouldn't be
lieve it was in one of his own books
until I found it for him."
Senator Frye of Maine says that
while in Paris he needed a hair cut, so
he studied carefully the necessary por
tion of his "French Conversation Book"
and did his best to make the barber
understand. "I don't understand Dutch,"
said the person addressed. "Do you
speak English?"
A good story is told by Rudyard Kip
ling at his own expense. During his
stay in Wiltshire, England, one sum
mer he met little Dorothy Drew, Mr.
Gladstone's granddaughter, and, being
possibilities and prophesying as to its
future.
He forecasts that the size of the auto
mobile, while not yet greatly differing
from the ordinary one or two horse
wagon, will increase in time to an enor
mous extent and that its weight may
even reach a Vegister of thousands of
tons. The liveryman will be replaced
by the dispenser of coal, electricity and
1 petroleum, and instead of water troughs
1 along the principal highways there will
be seen innumerable electric storage de
pots.
This French prophet attempts to
straighten out the economic knot by
1 forecasting that the horse will in time
become a delectable and much sought
after feod animal. He holds that a life
of leisure will restore the proper amount
of succulence to the flesh of the now
overworked quadruped, and that a time
will come when horse steaks will be
served at all restaurants and their con
sumption will be looked upon as a mat
ter of course. This Parisian prophet also
foresees the traveling shop and the itin
erant theater. An immense automobile
will carry along both actors, scenery and j
playhouse. On the upper floors of the
great wheeled building will be the
apartments of the company, who will
not have to pack and unpack their be
longings each day.
A train de luxe will become the fash
ionable means by which pleasure out
ings will be taken, and summer travel
ing will no longer be done on dusty and
crowded railway trains. A circuit court
will move from town to town in full
session on wheels, and even funeral
processions will consist of a number of
automobiles linked together like a train
of cars.
All this sounds more or less like a
page from a fairy tale book or the idle
dream of a mere visionary. It repre
sents, nevertheless, something far more
substantial, for it is the conviction of a
farseeing and scholarly French scien
tist, who has had the opportunity of
studying the different inventions which
are slowly but surely being brought to a
state of perfection in his own country,
which may well be called the birthplace
and the home of the horseless carriage.

        <text>NEW ELECTRIC ASSOCIATION.
Formed In This City to Farther In
terest of F.lrrtrlrs.
A meeting of the electric vehicle manu
facturers and the central station Interests
of this city held on Thursday of last week
resulted In the formation of a cooperative
organization known as the New York
Electric Vehicle Association. The object
of the association is to boom the electric
vehicle Industry In New York city. It
will In no way conflict with the Klectriu
Vehicle Association of America,, the na
tional body.
Among other plans under consideration
by the plan and scope committee are tho
establishment of a common showroom to be
centrally located antl equipped with model
charging taiilitles antl the maintenance
of u list of duly inspectetl ami reliable
garages about tho city, together with a
catalogue of other useful touring informa
tion. ihe membership of tho association will
consist of corporations anil firms engaged
III tint iiianulacturu and sale of electric
vehicles, electric vehicle batteries or elec
tric motors and corporations anil firms
engaged in the sale of electric current.
A secretary will shortly bo appo luted who
will devote his entire tlmn to association
work. He will at all times be at the call of
members who may require such services as he
ho may have al his command, rendering
anr assistance which would tend to a better,
smoother or more convenient condition
or arangement under which electric auto
mobiles might be operatetl. Among other
considerations of importance is the possi
bility of cooperative atlvertslng on a largo
scale. Announcement will be made later
of the officers and the board of directors.

the number of electrics In ue In New

From the reports of manufacturers there
Is no doubt that the rate of Increase Is
Steadily maintained. Several traffic en
gineers ore of the opinion that ten yearn
from now the number of electric com
mercial vehicles In this city ns well as
In other larne centres will exceed by sev
eral times the number of as trucks used.
.One manufacturer of electric trucks re
ports that his concern sold ten times as
many cars last year as he did In the
past ten years put tORethor. Another
manufacturer reports that In the first
mix months of 1912 his factory sold us
many trucks as It dirt In the entire year
of 1911. A third manufacturer disposed of
BO per cent, more cars last year than
the year before. Other manufacturers
report similar experiences,
The electrical exposition which opens
in Grand Central Palace to-morrow will
bear evidence of the wonderful Krowth
of the electric automobile, both for utili
tarian and for pleasure purposes. Busi
ness wagons of all sorts will be on exhi
bition, as will also the pleasure vehicle
which Is very popular with women.
Speaking of the rapid prosiess made
fcy thp electric vehicle during the past
few years a dealer who sells electrics
In New York makes the following com
ment: "The development of the electric com
mercial vehicle field can be measured by
the development of battery equipment
Sor thest- vehicles. Users of thrm know
the simplicity nf the electric truck from
Hn operative viewpoint. There Is very
little to get out of order, and should any
mishap develop every part of the vehicle
Is easily accessible. There Is lew to woar
out In an electric than In any other kind
of motor vehicle. The speed of the elec
tric Increases ns Increased power Is ap
plied, and applying power conslta simply
In throwing a switch. Kverythlng Is done
with n single lever Instead nf several.
The steering control Is easy and sure.
This makes a great saving of time In
threading congested city traffic. The ease
of operation and control Is ns good as
nn Insurance policy on the car.
"The garage problem Is very much sim
plified by electrics In that they Involve no
unusual fire risk nnd can be housed on the
business premises of the owner. Thus
they save all the loss of time Involved In
going from the garage to, wherever the
work of tho car Is to begin nnd making
the return trip at night.It Is estimated that at present there
are 1,800 electric vehicles In New York
city, of which 400 nri pleasure cars and
1.400 commercials. Up to this time New
York has not been listed among the cities
th'.t are known as "good electric towns,"
parti). It Is supposed, for the reason that
the working of Idle machines of the pleas
ure car type In the streets Is not per
mitted In other cities where owners of
electrics aic permitted to leave them un
attended while shopping or intending to
buslnti-a, their use has Increased more

more cars of this description thon in New

Is with the Idea of remedying this con
